# About:

In this project, I created a tic-tac-toe game using only HTML to structure the site, CSS to bring the game to life and Javascript for the player's choices, allowing the execution of a move and giving the game a winner. The purpose of this project is to use basic concepts on how I can create very simple work projects, using only their basic functions and a little logic. This project was a challenge through DIO - Digital Innovation One with teacher Vitor Ruschoni.

# Goals and plans:

The objective of this project was to learn how to create games through HTML, CSS and JavaScript to learn new concepts. This was my first game behind a website and I plan to recreate new ones soon. I want to learn new diversities and how far I can go with it.
